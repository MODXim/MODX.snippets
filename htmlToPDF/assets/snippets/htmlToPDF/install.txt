Installation instructions for htmlToPDF
(Current Version: 0.1.3.1)

The TCPDF files are part of this package.

Upload all files inside the assets folder to your web-space. The lib folder
already contains a htacces file, that disallows every call from the web.
If you don't want to use the default path used for TCPDF and htmlToPDF, that is
not a problem, but you need to configure the snippet with the path informations,
or give the path informations with the snippet call.

If you want a logo in the page header, you have to upload the logo the folder
assets/lib/tcpdf/images/. This is because TCPDF only uses this folder, to
look images files.

Create two new snippets:
htmlToPDF       -> assets/snippets/htmlToPDF/snippet.htmlToPDF.php.tpl
getCurrentDocID -> assets/snippets/htmlToPDF/snippet.getCurrentDocID.php.tpl

Create on new plugin
htmlToPDF       -> assets/plugins/htmlToPDF/plugin.htmlToPDF.tpl
On the page "System Events" choose these two options in the area "Documents":
- OnBeforeDocFormDelete
- OnDocFormSave

Create the PDF output path and give the rights, to create and delete files
there (777). The default is assets/pdf/, but you may configure it to fit your
needs.

Now create the chunks, that you want to use in your snippet calls. You may create
different chunks for different websites, if you use htmlToPDF in different
templates.
Open the templates, where you want to use htmlToPDF and add the call to the
chunk at the top of the template. Here is an example of a call:
[!htmlToPDF? &author=`Stefanie Janine Stoelting` &tvKeywords=`documentTags` &headerLogo=`logo.png` &chunkContentFooter=`pdf-contentfooter` &chunkStandardHeader=`pdf-header-text` &chunkStyle=`pdf-style`!]

For further information about the snippet parameters read the documentation in
parameter-descriptions.html.

The file assets/snippets/htmlToPDF/chuncks/pdf-link.txt contains a chunk to
generate a link for the PDF download. If you place the call outside the content,
the link to the PDF call is not part of the PDF document.
